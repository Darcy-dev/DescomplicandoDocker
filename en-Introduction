# Preface

If you are a developer, you probably have heard about Docker by now:
Docker is the ideal platform to run applications in containers. Fine,
but what are those containers? Containers are a lightweight
virtualization technique providing us with lots of possibilities: thanks
to them, we can ship applications faster; we can easily implement CI/CD
(continuous integration and continuous delivery); we can set up
development environments faster than ever; we can ensure parity between
those development environments and our production servers; and much
more. If you write code, if you deploy code, if you operate code, then I
promise that containers are going to make your life easier.

But containers have been around for *decades*, and Docker was only
released in 2013. So what's the big deal? Why is everybody so excited
about Docker, if the technology behind it is more than ten years old?

Because the main innovation of Docker is not the technology. The main
innovation of Docker is to make this technology available to every
developer and sysadmin, very easily, without having to spend years of
practice to become an expert, and without requiring to develop tons of
custom tools.

I will share a secret with you: the really important thing is not Docker
and containers. What is really important is to improve the quality of
our software, reduce our development and deployment costs, release
better, more reliable code, faster. It turns out that Docker is an
insanely efficient way to achieve those goals. That's why it is so
popular.

This book will teach you all you need to know to get started with
Docker, and use it to build, ship, and run your applications. It will be
your guide in the world of containers, and on the path to ship code
better than you ever did before.

# About the book

The purpose of this book is to help you build **containerized** environments with
the tool that is revolutionizing technology companies 
around the world: let's learn and play with the sensational Docker.!

In a light and totally practical way, we will learn what Docker is and how to create 
a Docker cluster with several running containers! Always in a practical way, we will cover important topics
so that you can manage environments that use or intend to use Docker.

We will even learn how to set up custom dockerfiles for building container images, as well as how to better manage them.

We will also see in practice how to use the **Docker Machine** to create Docker hosts, either on-premises or in the cloud. 
We will create a cluster using Swarm and learn how to scale our environment using Compose.

In this second edition we have added many new features, like 'docker secret' and 'docker stack', and updated almost all the rest of
the book to make it more up-to-date and didactic. We have added more practical examples, 
so that your experience can be even more enjoyable and profitable.


# Introduction

If you are a developer who has always dreamed of being able to reproduce the
production environment on your machine or the application you have designed and
developed can run in production easily, with the same "binary" that
that was used in the testing moments\...

\...Imagine being able to install and test several applications quickly and simulate a complete environment
,much lighter and smarter than the virtual machines
in a matter of minutes..

If you are a system administrator who has always dreamed of no longer having to
to prepare your servers to support thousands of different applications, made in different languages, with different libraries, 
with different versions (Whew)...

\...Imagine saving millions of hours in new server installations, application upgrades, deploys, overnight service calls because
of services that "failed" and could not run on other servers due to various incompatibilities..

If you need to scale your environment in a matter of minutes to support a demand that has caught
you by surprise after a campaign from your company's marketing department...\...

If you are a manager and are worried about the datacenter bill at the end of the month 
because of the amount of resources needed to make your environment work....\....

And even when you have all the computing resources to support the demand, 
if you realize that most of the time your resources are idle and your team is struggling to equalize them...\...

\...So this book and Docker were made for you! Good reading, enjoy!
